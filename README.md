## Hello world

<!--
About me:
I am a computer science major at the University of Central Florida, class of 2028, with a minor in cybersecruity. My aspirations are to hopefully join the cyber operations in the Space Force at Patrick Space Force Base.

My general hobbies are working out, listening to music, and driving my car.

Right now, I am currently learning C. I also have rudementary knowledge of JavaScript, C#, Python, and a tiny bit of Lua.


How to reach me: 
"za431658@ucf.edu" for emails
"@zayne.doc" on Instagram


Fun fact: 
I have a real eyebrow scar, I got it from sleep-walking into a door frame when I was about 8 or 9 y/o
